Step 1: Create a YAML file for Nginx Deployment
To start, connect to the master ec2 instance via SSH as the root user.
You need to create a YAML file for Deploying the web application which will be further exposed using NodePort service.
Name of the YAML file –nginx-deploy.yaml
The content of the YAML files is shown below 

cat > nginx-deploy.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:1.27
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF


In the above manifest file,the name of the Deployment is ‘nginx-deployment’ as highlighted under name section.
The Deployments is creating one replica of nginx-container image 1.7.9 as highlighted in the replicas and containers section respectively.
The Label of the Pod is ‘nginx-app’ as highlighted in the labels section, the same pod label is to be used during the creation of the NodePort Service.

To deploy the above nginx deployment you need to give the command –
kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
To view the Deployment and the Pod created by this deployment you can give the below commands –
kubectl get deploy
kubectl get pods

Step 2:
Create a YAML file for the NodePort Service
You need to create a YAML file for creating the NodePort service.
Name of the YAML file –nginx-service-sample.yaml
The content of the YAML file is shown below –
cat > nginx-service-sample.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service	
metadata:
  name: nodeport-service
  labels:
    app: test-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-app
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - nodePort: 31111
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
EOF

In the above manifest file, the name of the NodePort service is ‘nodeport-service’ as mentioned in the name section of metadata highlighted.
In the selector section the same Pod label is mentioned which was given while deploying the nginx deployment in the previous step which is ‘nginx-app’.
The Nginx application is being exposed on the port 31111 as mentioned in the node Port section as highlighted.
Kindly ensure the TCP port 31111 is open in the security group of the instances.

To deploy the above NodePort service you need to give the command –
kubectl create -f nginx-service-sample.yaml
To view the Deployment and the Pod created by this deployment you can give the below commands–
kubectl get svc
Step4:
Creating a sample HTMLpage to test the NodePort service
To create a webpage in the Pod deployed, you need to get the name of Pod by giving the command –
kubectl get pods
To go inside the Pod to create the webpage, the below command can be given -kubectl exec [POD-NAME(from previous command)] -it -- /bin/sh

Once inside the Pod the below shown webpage can be created by giving the command shown below

cat <<EOF > /usr/share/nginx/html/test.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Testing..</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="color:rgb(90,70,250);">Hello, replica Service...!</h1>
<h2>Congratulations, you are great :-) </h2>
</body>
</html>
EOF


 type exit

The above command creates a html file test.html

Step 5:
Test using Node IP (external IP)
To access the Webpage created in the previous step from the local browser we need to give the URL as shown below –
Kubectl get pods -o wide    ----to know the particular worker where the pod is running

http://<Public_IP_of_worker_instance_where_pod_is_deplyed>:<nodePort>/<html_file_name.html>
In this case the URL will be –http://<Public_IP_of_worker_instance_where_pod_is_deplyed>:31111/test.html

Kubectl get pods -o wide    ----to know the particular worker where the pod is running

The Public IP of the worker instance where the Pod is deployed can be found out from the AWS EC2 management console.

Step 6:
Cleaning up the resources
 The deployments and the service created can be deleted by giving the below commands –
kubectl delete -f <filename/path of deployment manifest file>

kubectl delete -f <filename/path of service manifest file>
